# DOA_slam
We will release our code upon acceptance to provide complete information about our implementation and to facilitate future work. And supplementary materials will come soon!!!ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ Please hold on!!!ðŸŒ¹ðŸŒ¹ðŸŒ¹

# Supplementary materials
We have uploaded the SupplementaryMaterial.pdf, including:

1.Why DRL and why PPO?

2.What problems have we solved compared to other approaches?

3.Comparison experiment with Cartographer and other SOTA methods (on the way!!!)

From Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, it can be seen that all maps constructed by Cartographer are wrong. However, our method can improve SLAM's performance in degenerate environments by using the degeneracy optimization module, so as to build more accurate environment maps and improve localization accuracy. Please see SupplementaryMaterials.pdf for detailed quantitative analysis.
